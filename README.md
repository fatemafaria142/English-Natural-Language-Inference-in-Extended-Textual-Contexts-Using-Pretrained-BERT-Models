# A Comprehensive Study in Natural Language Inference with MultiNLI Corpus

## Overview
This repository contains code for Natural Language Inference (NLI) leveraging DistilBERT and mBERT models on the MultiNLI dataset. 

## Dataset
- **MultiNLI Dataset**: The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) (available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli?row=1)) comprises 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information. The corpus is modeled on the SNLI corpus, but differs in that covers a range of genres of spoken and written text, and supports a distinctive cross-genre generalization evaluation. 

## Models
- **DistilBERT and mBERT**: Utilizing these transformer-based models provided by Hugging Face Transformers library,I explore their effectiveness in handling passage-level NLI tasks on the ConTRoL dataset. 

## Usage
To replicate this experiments or use the code:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Utilize the provided scripts and notebooks to train, fine-tune, or evaluate DistilBERT and mBERT models on the ConTRoL dataset.
